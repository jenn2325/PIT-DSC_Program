# Data Science Project: Parsing Science Policy Issues Data
last edited: June 10th, 2021

## Opportunity

Sci4NY wants to visualize the top science-related policy issues by each NYC community district in order to create dialogue that science knowledge can help create better policy about important community/borough issues. One of their biggest bottlenecks is extracting data from pdf reports/websites. Having to enter data manually would be very time-consuming.

Is it possible to generate an systematic method of parsing NYC community district reoports pdf documents or district profile websites so that it could ease the data collection process?

## Current State

New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) have published [NYC Community Health Profiles](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-publications/profiles.page) pdf documents for 59 community district, each captures the health of 59 community districts across the city. They contain over 50 measures of neighborhood health. These reports highlight the disparities among neighborhoods and can be used by policymakers, community groups, health professionals, researchers and residents to encourage community engagement and action.

New York City Department of City Planning published [Community District Profiles](https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov) for each of 59 community districts. The profiles addresses the most pressing concerns, i.e. the top three pressing issues perceived and identified by that community district. 

Google Cloud now provides [Optical Character Recognition](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr) (OCR) technology that could help detect and extract text from images.

## Requirements and metrics

- Deliverable
  - likely a deliverable is a manually labeled test set (of pdfs) so in later improvements we know if something breaks. You may want to create an algorithm to detect issues, e.g. compare the time series of these metrics and if one deviates too far then flag them.
  - A systematic algorithm that automatically extract the relevant data we need from Community Health Profiles pdf documents & Community District Profiles, and merge 59 community districts data. 
  - A final dataset with each row represents one districtsâ€™ information, and each column represents a relevant feature. 
  
\begin{itemize}
\item Metrics
\begin{itemize}
    \item Websites:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Minimum Parsing Coverage: 90\%
    \item Minimum Parsing Correctness: 90\%
    \end{itemize}
  \item Health Profiles:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Minimum Parsing Coverage: all the tabular formatted data
    \item Ideal Parsing Coverage: 100\%
    \item Minimum Parsing Correctness: 90\% for all tabular formatted data
    \end{itemize}
  \item Time your algorithm and make sure the running time is within a reasonable time
  \end{itemize}
\item Stretch Goal
  \begin{itemize}
  \item An interactive Mapping to present multiple information.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Data Validation

- Please verify if the profile is reported uniformly across all the districts
- How are the missing values distributed over the fields?


|       [The profiles is formatted uniformly across all the districts.]

|       [Only Children avoidable hospitalization data is missing in certain districts.]

## Hand-off and maintenance

The project is complete when

  - The following code is documented
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Web scrapping algorithm for extracting top three pressing issues in NYC district profiles websites.
    \item PDF parsing algorithm for extracting main seven category data from Health Profile pdf documents.
    \item Advise a way to validate the quality of the data extraction(human in the loop process might be necessary).
  \end{itemize}
  - A data frame with each row represents one districts' data and each column represents a feature is compiled from 59 districts' Data.
