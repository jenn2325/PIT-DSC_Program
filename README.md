# PIT-DSC_Program
### Our Team 
We are a team of 5 Columbia/Lehman Data Scientist, who participated in the <b> Public Interest Technology Data Science Corps internship </b>, from June 2021 to August 2021.

### Our Goal
 
Our goal was to parse all the community health profiles (by community district) of New York city in order to aide the public interest organization: Sci4NY. Our aim was to create clean data tables that would then be utilized by Sci4NY to push for science/data grounded policies.

Manually entering data from each health profile would be time consuming, therefore our team wrote an R markdown file that parsed each pdf and placed the data into an excel spreadsheet. This R markdown is meant to be reusable for future parsing needs.
